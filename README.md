### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tugba
#### I am Jr. Data Analyst


I graduated from the Economics Department of YÄ±ldÄ±z Technical University. I decided to pursue a career as a data analyst because I enjoy working with data and particularly deriving insights from the data I manipulate. To gain knowledge in this field, I have taken many courses and undertaken various projects to gain practical experience. My goal is to develop my knowledge and experience in data analysis and become an expert professional.

I have a solution-oriented personality, which helps me effectively solve the problems I encounter. I am confident in my communication skills, which makes me a good team player; I believe I can collaborate effectively with my colleagues.

Through the training I have received, I have developed skills in Excel, SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Power BI, customer segmentation, and CRM. The journey is long, and there is much to learn, so I continue to improve my analytical skills by staying informed about industry innovations, using the knowledge and experience I gained during my education.

I am on LinkedIn to connect with like-minded professionals, share experiences, and explore new career opportunities. Thank you for visiting my profile.
